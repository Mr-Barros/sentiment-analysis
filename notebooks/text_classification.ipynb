      "Original: I (17M) have come to the realisation that My dad is a prick. Ever since i was little he never really cared about me, he saw me as more of an extension of himself. it is always been about getting a good carreer and getting an education. My granddad is the same. Until age 12 I thought that taking an extra education after school was a law. I legit thought that I had to get into a Gymnasium or something like wise, by law.When I was about 6 years old, I could not sleep one night. So as a normal kid, I went into My parents room and said: \"I cannot sleep\" My mom was ready to tuck me in, but My dad said: \"You say that all the time, and you always fall asleep anyway.\" To this day that memory is still crystal clear in my mind. My granddad calls me fat everytime we visit him, and always ask if I know what gymnasium I am going to next year, or what job I want in the future.Time and time again my dad's side of the family has showed to me that they cannot be trusted and are not worthy of my time. However there are a couple people from the family that I quite enjoy sending time with.My question is: \"How do you cut ties with a parent and their side of the family, when you still live under their roof and they own you financielly and yet keeping in touch with a select few People?Tl;dr: My dad and most of his side of the family are pricks, how is a good way to cut ties with them while being underage?
